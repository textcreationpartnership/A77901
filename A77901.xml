         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:168360:3"/> ſubject of my Preaching-labours; ſo that my frequent Preaching, did not onely interrupt and ſpend my time, but did alſo divert and place my thoughts upon matters Forein and Heterogeneal; yet I think if my ordinary Sermons were penned ſo exactly, and my ſtile ſo punctuall and elaborate, as many of my Brethrens be, I ſhould have been more able and ready for the Preſs, but I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſtudy matter, &amp; take ſuch words as offered themſelves, and were ſuggeſted in the time of ſpeaking: being therefore now for to compoſe, and think of every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wrote, I found it heavier and harder than my Sermons ever were. Theſe rubs have much retarded my ingaged ſervice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to my Brethren, and the Church, and Cauſe of God, if happily it may be thought to be concerned in theſe lucubrations.</p>
            <p>I have made bold to uſe the <hi>Plurall</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe I deſigned to be your common mouth, <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> and to publiſh nothing but what I had ground to think was
<pb facs="tcp:168360:3"/> all your ſenſes, as by many of the Writings received from you, I ſhall be able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, if required.</p>
            <p>If any think, I have been light and laviſh in illuſtrations, let them conſider, this is my firſt piece, and hanging long upon the wheel, I was conſtrained to refreſh my ſelf with toyes and ſtories, which I thought might happily be a refection alſo unto others, and eaſe the tedium of a long diſcourſe; yet I hope it hath not hindred light, nor any way impeached the ſtrength and cleerneſs of the matter; what ever it is, I humbly offer it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your worths, taking it as a great favour from God, and reſpect from you, that I was thought worthy to be accounted,</p>

                     <hi>Church,</hi> which never was denied it, by any <hi>Orthodox unbiaſſed Chriſtian.</hi> It was many hundred years before any body queſtioned this truth, or pretended unto any power to attend and act in holy things, unleſs they had been ſet apart unto it,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:168360:64"/> as we have ſhewed before: ſince ſome have done it, but they were either not Orthodox, or not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed.

                     <note n="(u)" place="margin">2 King 5: 20.</note>, but would not ſuddenly fall foul upon the places, but reſolved firſt, to uſe all means to work on <hi>Luther,</hi> and win him to them if it were poſſible,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168360:65"/> and <hi>Muncer</hi> for that end, went often to him, unto <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> to work him to a good opinion of their way; but when they ſaw they could not do it, they reſolved to carry it without him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told the people in their Sermons, that <hi>Luthers</hi> reformation was imperfect, that he had lopt ſome of the branches off, but left the roots of bitterneſſe ſtill growing in the ground, and that was temporal and worldly greatneſſe, whereby Gods people were ſtill inſlaved and oppreſſed; that it was the minde and will of God, that all men ſhould be free, and all things common, that one man ſhould not domineere and reign over another; that the Princes were as grievous <hi>Tyrants</hi> as the Pope; that God would have mens perſons and Eſtates exempt and free, as well as their conſciences and inward man; and becauſe it was not like that Princes, and poſſeſſors of great Eſtates, would entertain theſe truths upon propoſals and exhortations, they ſhould be forced to it; &amp; that Arms in that caſe are not only lawful, but expedient and very neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>There had been tumults and inſurrections in thoſe upper parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome years before the Country boors had taken Arms, and been in action againſt their Governours; and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny treaties of peace had been, and many skirmiſhes and bickerings, wherein the Boors and Countrey people had the worſt, yet ſtill they kept up Arms, and could not be reduced and brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, <hi>ſeditio irritatur remedio,</hi> ſedition is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that is inraged by the proper remedy: if you ſtroak them, &amp; ſpeak them fair, they think you flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, &amp; are unable to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend with them: if you ſuppreſs and cut them off, they cry out of your

                     <hi>the wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt.</hi> When therefore theſe unruly fellows heard that ſome Preachers did encourage Arms, they flocked exceedingly to thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and <hi>Muncer</hi> and <hi>Pheiffer</hi> ſpared no bellows to increaſe this flame; whereby the reformation then began by <hi>Luther,</hi> and thoſe famous helpers and aſſociates of his, began exceedingly to ſuffer; for theſe (they ſaid) were thoſe things that they aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at indeed, namely, the violation of mens tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and civil rights, whatever they pretended; ſo that <hi>Luther</hi> and his fellows were conſtrained for to write expreſly, and ſomewhat bitterly againſt them, and to ſtir up their ſuperiours to ſuppreſſe theſe tumultuous and dangerous inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>When they ſaw <hi>Luther</hi> and the others had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt them, &amp; by there publiſhed writings were ingaged, they then reſolved to cry them down as faſt as could be, and told the people, that <hi>Luther</hi> had only publiſhed a carnal Goſpel, and ſet upon a reformation, but not effected it, and brought it unto any ripeneſſe and maturity; that God had called and raiſed him up, to perfect what <hi>Luther</hi> had begun, and to root out all the wicked of the world, and ſettle righteouſneſs; but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing he muſt uſe edged tools, and that there was no jeſting with them, he thought it needful to bring men under ſome reall and new ingagement, that might binde theſe Ropes of ſand together,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168360:66"/> and lay ſome tie upon the moveable, and giddy multitude, to keep them cloſe together, againſt the common enemy, that would be united in their properties and common intereſts ſufficiently: bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is therefore reſolved upon, to be the bond of this iniquity, as being the moſt plauſible Character that they could think of, to diſtinguiſh theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from other Chriſtians; and becauſe Infant-baptiſme was more expoſed unto exceptions, then any other point of Doctrine, they reſolve to enter at this breach, upon that ſtage whereon they were to act thoſe Tragedies they had prepared. And when after many tryals and eſſayes, they found thoſe Scriptures they had mounted with all their art, would not make this breach wide enough for them to enter, they flie to <hi>Revelations</hi> and <hi>enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſms;</hi> and becauſe they found the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and godly Miniſters did every where obſtruct their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings and attempts, they cry down them, and ſet up others in their places that were <hi>mechanicks,</hi> and would be tractable to any enterprize. And this was the true riſe of theſe oppoſers of a Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; And that they were not <hi>Orthodox,</hi> will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by their endeavours to introduce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of all things; by preaching the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of oaths in caſes criminal; by their refuſing to bear Arms againſt a common enemy invading of their native Countrey, as thoſe of <hi>Zurich</hi> in <hi>Helvetia</hi> did about the year 1636. as <hi>Spanhemius</hi> and others do relate at large, would not make uſe of a Sword, commended and commanded to them by their natural and lawful Governours, and yet would take one up forbidden: to ſay nothing of

                  <p>And that they were not unbiaſſed, their whole courſe proved, inriching themſelves with thoſe Revenues that they robbed others of; for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had ſmoother words, and better lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to incourage undertaking, yet the motive was the very ſame with thoſe in <hi>Solomon,</hi> as it is <note n="(y)" place="margin">Prov. 1. 11, 12, 13.</note>, namely, <hi>we ſhall finde all precious ſubſtance, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoile:</hi> as did manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in thoſe at <hi>Munſter,</hi> who rioted and revelled in the City, when others periſhed for want of bread.</p>
                  <p>And for thoſe <hi>Arrians</hi> in <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> that ſucked this poyſon from them, and do man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it with greater prudence and obſervation, we hope, we have to do with none that do not think them orthodox.</p>
                  <p>Whoever ſince have ſtruggled and fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this truth, have gone down unto theſe <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims,</hi> to fetch their weapons, or to ſharpen them; for we deny not, but honeſt men may be <hi>erroneous,</hi> and have a <hi>bias clapt upon them by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lie in wait for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in this very caſe <note n="(z)" place="margin">Eph. 4. 14.</note>: we think therefore, that we have juſt exceptions, and grounds of challenging this Jury, that is ſo ready for to paſſe upon us, and think it fit, the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances wherein ſo great a cauſe is weighed, ſhould be examined, and firſt ſet even.

                  <p>HAving now finiſhed our Arguments, we come unto the next thing, and that is, to anſwer ſuch objections as uſually are brought againſt this truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. To attend and act in holy things, is Gods work, for its an attendance upon the things of God, as we have ſhewed before, and we ſhould let God do his own work, and not think we can do it better, unleſſe we could imagine he wanted ſtrength, or were himſelf unwilling for to do it; but he hath promiſed, and is ingaged himſelf to do it <note n="(y)" place="margin">Iſa. 54. 13</note>, and hath forbidden us to meddle, ſaying, <hi>they ſhall teach no more, every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord</hi>

                     <hi>can come unto me, unleſſe my Father which hath ſent me draw him;</hi> and converſion is a new Creation; for <hi>if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note>; and it is not good for to preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupate and intercept Gods purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The work (no doubt) is Gods work, and he is the efficient and over-ruling agent in it, yet in this, as in other acts and operations, admits of inſtruments; he is, we do acknowledge, the firſt,

                  <p>But ſure we are, that all may propheſie; for all are bidden <hi>to deſire it,</hi> and follow after it, as they are bound and bidden to <hi>follow after charity</hi> 
                     <note n="(o)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 1.</note>, and it is for that end commended to them, all that Chapter over: and when they have it, they may uſe and exerciſe it <note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 31.</note>: ye may all propheſie, that is, imploy and exerciſe that gift which God hath given you, as thoſe that had their <hi>Maſters Goods,</hi>

                     <hi>let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge;</hi> neither can this reſtriction be refuſed; for whoſoever doth propheſie, ſhewes thereby plainly, that he is a Prophet; for qualified acts denominate the ſubject wherein they are; he that ruleth is a Ruler, he that teacheth a Teacher, and he that propheſieth a Prophet. <hi>Saul</hi> was a moſt unlikely peece to make a Prophet, yet when he alſo propheſied, it could not be denied him <note n="(u)" place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 23, 24.</note>.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168360:102"/> it beſt to ſay in the beginning, what we mean not by Ordination. As he that came unto the muſter, with a great ſaddle on his back, and the other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture about him, thought good to tell the Muſter-maſter firſt of all, that he was not an Horſe: we would not have our Readers jealous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have reſolved to tell them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by Ordination, we mean no politick or civil power. When we opened the meaning of the termes, &amp; did ſtate the queſtion, we told you, that by Church, we did not mean a civil or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Aſſembly, but confin'd our ſelves to Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical and ſpiritual affairs: ſo now by Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we do not mean any civil or political practice, but only Eccleſiaſtical; an Office we confeſs it is, as it is called <note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 12. 7 Rom. 11. 13.</note>, but hardly worth the having: yea it is an honour, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="(f)" place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>no man taketh unto himſelf this honour;</hi> but exceeding low and under-valued, that no man is ambitious of it: yea it is, and may be called a power, <note n="(g)" place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 8.</note>

When Lawes were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Statutes and Acts of Parliament, this Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not, nor in reaſon could not be expected; but ſince they have been called Ordinances, they have affinity with Ordination. When <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour had forſook his godly Fathers way, and was become a Patron of the Arrians, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Orthodox and godly Miniſters, he grew extreamly jealous, and ſuſpected all that had capacities of undermining and ſupplanting him,

What is granted and allowed to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by the Laws and Cuſtomes of this Nation, cannot be reaſonably denyed; for the Laws of <hi>England</hi> have never favoured Uſurpation in the Clergy of this Nation, but ſtickled and contended againſt the innovations and invaſions both of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein and Domeſtick Juriſdictions, eſpecially ſince <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman</hi> did ſeparate the Courts, and ſet the Clergy by themſelves, who before were always in the ſame Court, and on the ſame Bench, with the Civil Governours, as appears by the ſeveral &amp; frequent prohibitions that were granted by the Judges of the Upper Bench, and by the Lawyers pleaded for; but the Lawes and Cuſtomes of this Nation, allows unto the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> the uſe and exerciſe of Diſcipline as well as Doctrine; for ſuch of them as have Parſonages or Rectories,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:168360:178"/> are in all Proceſſe and Proceedings called Rectors, which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is Governours, whence ſome have thought that Rectories indeed were by Divine right, but not Vicaredges, becauſe they find it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the inſtitutions that God hath ſet in the Church, <note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28</note>, and God hath ſet in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecundarily Prophets, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, helps, Governments, <gap reason="foreign">

There was one in the Weſt that contended with Mr. <hi>Samuel Hieron,</hi> about the iniquity of Parochiall bounds, and ſaid they never were of Gods making, and it was not injury to give their dues to other Miniſters, and not their own; hee told him that he met a poor Fellow on the way, who begged ſomething for Gods ſake of him, he aſked him what he meant by that Hatchet that he carried at his girdle; the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low told him he was a Cooper by his Calling, and when he ſaw a young Aſh in a Hedge, he took his Hatchet and cut it up, and carried it along with him, to make an Hoop; Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> aſked him how he durſt ſteal another mans Aſhes; O Maſter (ſaid the Fellow) God never made Hedges; but wee think what the Lawes and Cuſtomes of a Nation makes, ſhould not bee cut up by any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
